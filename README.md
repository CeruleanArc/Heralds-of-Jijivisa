# The Heralds of Jijivisa App

A teeny, tiny project I didn't even intend to start work on. Anyway, now it's gone too far to stop. It's in Javascript, by the way, so it works with Discord!

> *"The official Heralds of Jijivisa App, coded by Lillian J. Wolf. Even in our darkest hours, a small part of SERA stayed with us. For some of us, it was all we had. It saved our lives. Thank you, SERA. Thank you, Archon Wolf."* â€”from *The Spirit of Humankind*, AE 43
